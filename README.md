This is my first crack at posting on GitHub, so let me know if I'm missing anything!

This project finds 5 5-letter words which have 25 different letters between them. My original goal was to write a program that could solve the problem in under 50 minutes. On my current machine, the code runs in about 4 minutes.

Other strategies for further optimization in the future would be reordering of the original list of words to place rare letters before common ones, removing aneagrams from the original list, and implementing a faster comparison function like bitwise AND.

I'm open to hearing other optimization strategies.
